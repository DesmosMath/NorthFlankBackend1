### Your Next Steps

1.  **Create a new GitHub repository.**
2.  **Add these four files** (`package.json`, `index.js`, `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`) to that repository and push them.
3.  **Sign up for Northflank** (using your GitHub account, no credit card needed).
4.  Create a new service, connect it to your new GitHub repository.
5.  When Northflank asks **how to build** your app, choose **"Dockerfile"** and point it to the `Dockerfile` in your repository.
6.  Deploy the service! It will give you a public URL that will **not sleep**.
